## Project information:
- To start this app: npm run dev 
- Project for sportswear ecommerce store.
- Header with a logo and navigation bar. The navigation bar contains 'All products' (as the home page), 'Trainers',' T-Shirts', 'Pants' (from where you can choose wanted products type), and Cart (cart icon and added products counter).
- When you open the cart and it's empty, a message appears indicating that the cart is empty along with the store's logo.
- Category section with dynamically changing name with drop-down sorter. All products can be sorted by four mechanisms: alphabetical a-z, alphabetical z-a, price ascending, and price descending.If there are products in the cart they will be rendered with item cards. Under them, there will be a 'Send order' button with which you can send it.
- In the products section there is a filter sidebar with three filtering mechanisms: brand, gender, and colors.Right of it there is a product grid field. At first, it loads two rows and four columns with product cards. If there are no items with chosen params message will be shown.
- Each card contains a product image, name, short description, price (ordinary or with discount), stars count (from one to five),  and an 'Add cart' button to add the current product to the cart.
- Under the products section, there is a counter that shows how many items comply with the filter requirements and  how many of them are rendered.
- With the 'Load more' button eight more items can be rendered (it'll render the rest if they are less than eight).
